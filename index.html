		<h2>Dwayne Morgan</h2>
		<p>I am a Computer Science major at the UWI. I also like photography and graphic designing. As a graphic artist, and a man that values how things look visually, Web development is but another way of expressing my creativity. It also is interesting to create something out of seemingly nonsensical strings of code and syntax. I will also be able to foster these skills, and translate them into the working world whether it be to design a website for a company or my own.</p>
